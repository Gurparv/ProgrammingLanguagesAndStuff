# Go is not a Object Oriented language so here to define a custom 'type' is different
## We will define a 'type' "deck" which is nothing but group of "cards"
## "cards" is nothing but 'slice' of string
## And to add a 'func' which applies to only 'type deck' we will create a function with receiver as 'type deck'

	- main.go ===> To demonstrate declaring a custom type 'deck' and a function which can only be used with custom type 'deck'. Basically mimicking creating a new custom class and its method
