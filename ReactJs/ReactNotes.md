### What is ReactJs and Why use it ?
- React is a javascript library for building 'modern' reactive websites.
- Why use it becoz of 'Modern' features.
	Traditionally websites were very unseamless becoz whenever we interact with them they send (http)requests , gets back responses(or new http pages or files) and then pages used to load and stuff on every click etc. 
	But now we want seamless user-experience . Some examples are Netflix website or mobile apps.
	For Netflix, we add some show to our favourite list and and immediately it is added to MyList , no more page loading.
	This way there is no latency effect and hence better user-experience.
- Question:
	Q. Cant JS alone can provide that seamless experience ? It does allow us to manipulate DOM(html structure)
	Q. Why we need React in addition to JavaScript.
	Answer: Inshort, React is all about creating small components (custom html elements), building blocks which makes code smaller. As oppose to using just Javascript.

React is a client-side javascript library for building 'modern' reactive websites which focuses on more declarative(high-level), component focussed approach.

### Single page application(SPAs) with React.
	- We could use React to control a part of html page or
	- to control the entire html page.In other words,Server only sends 1 html page. (Netflix Website is an example of this)
